Swarrot is PHP library to consume messages from any broker.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Swarrot is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Require the `swarrot/swarrot` package
into your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "swarrot/swarrot": "@stable"
    }
}
```

**Protip:** you should browse the
[`swarrot/swarrot`](https://packagist.org/packages/swarrot/swarrot)
page to choose a stable version to use, avoid the `@stable` meta constraint.

## Usage

### Basic usage

First, you need to create a message provider to retrieve message from your
broker. For example, with A PeclPackageMessageProvider (retrieve message from
an AMQP broker with the [pecl amqp package](http://pecl.php.net/package/amqp):

```php
use Swarrot\Broker\PeclPackageMessageProvider;

// Create connection
$connection = new \AMQPConnection();
$connection->connect();
$channel = new \AMQPChannel($connection);
// Get the queue to consume
$queue = new \AMQPQueue($channel);
$queue->setName('global');

$messageProvider = new PeclPackageMessageProvider($queue);
```

Once it's done you need to create a Processor to process messages retrieved
from the broker. This processor must implement
`Swarrot\Processor\ProcessorInterface`. For example:

```php
use Swarrot\Processor\ProcessorInterface;
use Swarrot\Broker\Message;

class Processor implements ProcessorInterface {
    public function process(Message $message, array $options) {
        echo sprintf("Consume message #%d\n", $message->getId());
    }
}
```


You now have a `Swarrot\Broker\MessageProviderInterface` to retrieve messages
and a Processor to process them. So, ask the `Swarrot\Consumer`to do it's job :

```php
use Swarrot\Message;

$consumer = new Consumer($messageProvider, $processor);
$consumer->consume();
```

### Using options

You can configure processor behaviour with options

```php
use Swarrot\Processor\ProcessorInterface;
use Swarrot\Broker\Message;

class Processor implements ProcessorInterface {
    public function process(Message $message, array $options) {
        $string = sprintf("Consume message #%d\n", $message->getId());
        str_repeat($string, $this->getMultiplier($options));
    }

    private function getMultiplier(array $options) {
        return isset($options['multiplier']) ? $options['multiplier'] : 1;
    }
}
```

Now pass options to processor through consumer:

```php
use Swarrot\Message;

$consumer = new Consumer($messageProvider, $processor);
$consumer->consume(array('multiplier' => 3));
```

### Using a stack

Heavily inspired by [stackphp/builder](https://github.com/stackphp/builder) you
can use `Swarrot\Processor\Stack\Builder` to stack your processors.
Using the [built in processors](#official-processors) or by [creating your
own](#create-your-own-processor), you can extend the behavior of your
base processor.
In this example, your processor is decorated by 2 others one. The
[ExceptionCatcherProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/ExceptionCatcher/ExceptionCatcherProcessor.php)
which decorate your own with a try/catch block and the
[MaxMessagesProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/MaxMessages/MaxMessagesProcessor.php)
which stop your worker when some messages have been consumed.

```php
use Swarrot\Processor\ProcessorInterface;
use Swarrot\Broker\Message;

class Processor implements ProcessorInterface {
    public function process(Message $message, array $options) {
        echo sprintf("Consume message #%d\n", $message->getId());
    }
}

$stack = (new \Swarrot\Processor\Stack\Builder())
    ->push('Swarrot\Processor\MaxMessages\MaxMessagesProcessor', new Logger())
    ->push('Swarrot\Processor\ExceptionCatcher\ExceptionCatcherProcessor')
    ->push('Swarrot\Processor\Ack\AckProcessor', $messageProvider)
;

$processor = $stack->resolve(new Processor());
```

Here is an illustration to show you what append when this order is used:

## Processors

### Official processors

* [AckProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/Ack)
* [Doctrine related processors](src/Swarrot/Processor/Doctrine) (thanks to [Adrien Brault](https://github.com/adrienbrault))
* [ExceptionCatcherProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/ExceptionCatcher)
* [InsomniacProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/Insomniac) (thanks to [Adrien Brault](https://github.com/adrienbrault))
* [InstantRetryProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/InstantRetry)
* [MaxExecutionTimeProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/MaxExecutionTime) (thanks to [Remy Lemeunier](https://github.com/remyLemeunier))

* [SignalHandlerProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/SignalHandler)

### Create your own processor

To create your own processor and be able to use it with the StackProcessor, you
just need to implement `ProcessorInterface` and to take another
`ProcessorInterface` as first argument in constructor.
