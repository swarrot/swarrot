Swarrot is a PHP library to consume messages from any broker.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Swarrot is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Require the `swarrot/swarrot` package:

    $ composer require swarrot/swarrot

## Usage

### Basic usage

First, you need to create a message provider to retrieve messages from your
broker. For example, with a `PeclPackageMessageProvider` (retrieves messages from
an AMQP broker with the [pecl amqp package](http://pecl.php.net/package/amqp):

```php
use Swarrot\Broker\MessageProvider\PeclPackageMessageProvider;

// Create connection
$connection = new \AMQPConnection();
$connection->connect();
$channel = new \AMQPChannel($connection);
// Get the queue to consume
$queue = new \AMQPQueue($channel);
$queue->setName('global');

$messageProvider = new PeclPackageMessageProvider($queue);
```

Once it's done you need to create a `Processor` to process messages retrieved
from the broker. This processor must implement
`Swarrot\Processor\ProcessorInterface`. For example:

```php
use Swarrot\Processor\ProcessorInterface;
use Swarrot\Broker\Message;

class Processor implements ProcessorInterface
{
    public function process(Message $message, array $options)
    {
        echo sprintf("Consume message #%d\n", $message->getId());

        return true; // Continue processing other messages
    }
}
```


You now have a `Swarrot\Broker\MessageProviderInterface` to retrieve messages
and a Processor to process them. So, ask the `Swarrot\Consumer` to do its job :

```php
use Swarrot\Consumer;

$consumer = new Consumer($messageProvider, $processor);
$consumer->consume();
```

### Using a stack

Heavily inspired by [stackphp/builder](https://github.com/stackphp/builder) you
can use `Swarrot\Processor\Stack\Builder` to stack your processors.
Using the [built in processors](#official-processors) or by [creating your
own](#create-your-own-processor), you can extend the behavior of your
base processor.
In this example, your processor is decorated by 2 other processors. The
[ExceptionCatcherProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/ExceptionCatcher/ExceptionCatcherProcessor.php)
which decorates your own with a try/catch block and the
[MaxMessagesProcessor](src/Swarrot/Processor/MaxMessages/MaxMessagesProcessor.php)
which stops your worker when some messages have been consumed.

```php
use Swarrot\Processor\ProcessorInterface;
use Swarrot\Broker\Message;

class Processor implements ProcessorInterface
{
    public function process(Message $message, array $options)
    {
        echo sprintf("Consume message #%d\n", $message->getId());
    }
}

$stack = (new \Swarrot\Processor\Stack\Builder())
    ->push('Swarrot\Processor\MaxMessages\MaxMessagesProcessor', new Logger())
    ->push('Swarrot\Processor\ExceptionCatcher\ExceptionCatcherProcessor')
    ->push('Swarrot\Processor\Ack\AckProcessor', $messageProvider)
;

$processor = $stack->resolve(new Processor());
```

Here is an illustration to show you what happens when this order is used:

### Queue interop usage

Swarrot supports [queue-interop](https://github.com/queue-interop/queue-interop) compatible MQ transports. 
It supports both sides: message publishing as well as their consumption. 
To start using it you have to find and install the queue-interop compatible library of a MQ broker you want to work with. 
In the library doc find out how to create its context. 

Send a message:

```php
<?php
use Swarrot\Broker\MessagePublisher\InteropMessagePublisher;
use Swarrot\Broker\Message;

/** @var \Interop\Queue\PsrContext $context */

$messagePublisher = new InteropMessagePublisher($context, 'aTopic');

$messagePublisher->publish(new Message('aBody'));
```

_**Note: ** The second argument `key` is only supported by [amqp interop](https://github.com/queue-interop/amqp-interop) based transports. For example, [RetryProcessor](https://github.com/swarrot/swarrot/tree/master/src/Swarrot/Processor/Retry) does not work cuz it rely on `key` argument._

Fetch a message:

```php
<?php
use Swarrot\Broker\MessageProvider\InteropMessageProvider;

/** @var \Interop\Queue\PsrContext $context */

$messageProvider = new InteropMessageProvider($context, 'aQueue');

if ($message = $messageProvider->get()) {
    // do stuff
    
    $messageProvider->ack($message);
}
```

### Create your own processor

To create your own processor and be able to use it with the `StackProcessor`, you
just need to implement `ProcessorInterface` and to take another
`ProcessorInterface` as first argument in constructor.
